## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Marissa Rico here!   - ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her/Ella

<div> 
With over twelve years of experience in the technology sector, Iâ€™ve honed a diverse skill set that spans Salesforce administration, AI leadership, CMS (WP) web development, and technical recruiting. My career has involved driving business development and sales across B2B, B2C, and M2M channels, while customizing training programs in Salesforce, SAP, and other cutting-edge technologies. Known for my creativity, problem-solving abilities, and a passion for learning, Iâ€™m continuously seeking new challenges. This led me to complete the GeeksHubs Academy Full Stack Developer Bootcamp, where I deepened my expertise in backend development, server logic, and database management, while also mastering frontend development to create dynamic, user-friendly experiences. I take a holistic approach to technology, ensuring that each solution I deliver is both functional and impactful, merging technical proficiency with a commitment to innovation.
 
I am passionate about technology and in the future I would like to become a Front-End Technical Lead. For  ten years of my career I was in contact with Salesforce as a key user administrator of this tool, supporting my company to launch its first Salesforce Community Cloud platform (Nowadays = Experience Cloud)  also being part of the mobile strategy, personalization, branding, engagement, e-commerce platform and integration of the core business Recruitment with customize vendor trainings for Universities, freelancers or companies. I supported the company by providing first level support (customer care)  to our global customers in the early stage of that project. 

<p> My goal and motivation is to continue leading the Salesforce Women in Technology Community Group with which I have been  volunteering for some years. </p> 


 I would like to continue deepening and learning tools such as redux, reactJs., AI Salesforce , MongoDB, Cypress Testing, UX/UI user experience, Javascript, digital marketing and python
